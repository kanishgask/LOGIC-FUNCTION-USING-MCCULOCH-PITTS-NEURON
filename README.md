# LOGIC-FUNCTION-USING-MCCULOCH-PITTS-NEURON
**McCulloch-Pitts Neuron for Logic Gates**
This project demonstrates the McCulloch-Pitts neuron model applied to basic logic gates (AND, OR, NAND, NOR).

**Features**
Initializes weights and bias for each logic gate

Computes weighted sum for all two-input combinations

Applies a step activation function with threshold

Displays outputs for each logic gate

**Requirements**
Python 3.x

**Usage**
Run the Python script to see the outputs of AND, OR, NAND, and NOR gates simulated by the McCulloch-Pitts neuron.
